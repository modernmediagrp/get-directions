Get Directions is a flexible, responsive map plugin , that uses MapQuest. Widget and shortcodes that auto detect mobiles.
== Description ==

The most comprehensive way for customers to get directions to your shop, office or location with ease on desktop, mobile & responsive themes 

Once you set the location, visitors to the website will be able to get directions to that location.

The plugin automatically picks up the visitor's location through the browser and mobile gps (when allowed).

Works on both desktop & mobile devices and can be used on full or responsive mobile websites. When your website is visited on mobile devices users get directions to the set location through Google Maps or the mobile device's default map app, making it easy for them to navigate to your location on the go.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= how do I change the color and size of the 'get directions' button? =
the button is totally styled in CSS so you can change this as you like in your theme's style.css=
= can I remove the credit link to llocally displayed under the maps? =
yes you can modify the source under the GPL, however for a very small donation we can tell how you to turn off tat link without coding
= can I change the style of the map pointer? =
for the route pointers (A to B) the style is fixed, but for the single map pin you can change these. There is a filter hook that can be coded in your theme's functions.php
= how do I use the shortcod e=
